# Example Configuration File: Highly Infectious Disease (e.g., Measles-like)
#
# This configuration models a very contagious disease:
# - High transmission rates
# - Low intervention effectiveness (disease spreads easily)
# - High reinfection potential
#
# Expected outcome: Still high >90% attack rate, rapid spread, short duration
# but with earlier die out.

# Simulator configuration
max: 60			# max number of rounds (shorter - burns out quickly)
verbose: False		# control sim() output

# Population parameters
N: 100			# number of agents
I: 5			# initial infecteds (larger initial outbreak)

# Agent interaction parameters
m: 8			# mixing parameter (high contact rate)

# Intervention parameters (Lowered effectiveness for highly infectious disease)
vp: 0.80		# prob of vaccination (80% vaccinated)
mp: 0.70		# prob of masking (70% masking - less effective for airborne)

# Transmission parameters (HIGH)
tpe: 0.70		# exposed transmission probability (VERY contagious)
tpi: 0.85		# infected transmission probability (extremely contagious)

# Disease progression parameters
de: 2			# days in exposed period (short incubation)
di: 6			# days in infected period
rp: 0.20		# recovery probability (LOW - 60% become susceptible again)

# Behavioral parameters
ap: 0.40		# asymptomatic probability (many don't know they're sick)
ip: 0.80		# isolation probability (low - many continue activities)

# Seed parameter
# seed: 11111

# NOTE: This scenario demonstrates how quickly a highly infectious disease
# can spread through a population even with higher interventions.
# Most of the population will be infected within 20-30 days.
