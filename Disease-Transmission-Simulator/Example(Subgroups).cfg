# Example Configuration File: Nursing Home Scenario
#
# This configuration models heterogeneous mixing between subgroups:
# - Group 0: General community (60 people)
# - Group 1: Healthcare workers (20 people) - bridge population
# - Group 2: Nursing home residents (15 people) - vulnerable, isolated
# - Group 3: Hospitalized patients (5 people) - very isolated
#
# Expected outcome: Demonstrates how isolation protects vulnerable populations

# Simulator configuration
max: 100		# max number of rounds
verbose: False		# control sim() output

# Population parameters (by subgroup)
N: 60, 20, 15, 5	# community, healthcare workers, nursing home, hospital
I: 2, 1, 0, 0		# initial infections (starts in community and healthcare)

# Agent interaction parameters
m: 6			# mixing parameter

# Intervention parameters
vp: 0.40		# prob of vaccination (moderate, 40%)
mp: 0.60		# prob of masking (high in healthcare settings, 60%)

# Transmission parameters
tpe: 0.35		# exposed transmission probability
tpi: 0.55		# infected transmission probability

# Disease progression parameters
de: 3			# days in exposed period
di: 5			# days in infected period
rp: 0.20		# recovery probability

# Behavioral parameters
ap: 0.30		# asymptomatic probability
ip: 0.50		# isolation probability

# Mixing matrix (% of interactions with each group)
# Rows = infectious agent's group, columns = who they interact with
0: 70, 20, 5, 5		# Community: mostly internal, some healthcare contact
1: 30, 40, 25, 5	# Healthcare: bridge between all groups
2: 10, 30, 60, 0	# Nursing home: isolated but some healthcare contact
3: 0, 50, 0, 50		# Hospital: only healthcare workers and other patients

# Interpretation:
# - Group 2 (nursing home) is relatively protected by isolation (60% internal)
# - Group 1 (healthcare) acts as a bridge, spreading between groups
# - Group 3 (hospital) is highly isolated (no community contact)
